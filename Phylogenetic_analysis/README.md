# Phylogenetic analysis

## Summary:

The XBB variant is a recombinant between PANGO lineages BJ.1 and BM.1.1.1. This directory contains
the results of the recombination analysis and phylogenetic reconstructions for each non-recombinant segment of the genomes.


## Data:
* [Recombination analysis results](recombination/xbb_bj1_bm1_rdp5.csv) determined with [RDP5](https://doi.org/10.1093/ve/veaa087).  
* [Tree inferred from the 5' end (major parent) non-recombinant segment](trees/xbb_bj1_bm1_norec_left_dated.nexus), time-calibrated using [TreeTime](https://github.com/neherlab/treetime). 
* [Tree inferred from the 3' end (minor parent) non-recombinant segment](trees/xbb_bj1_bm1_norec_right.nwk)
