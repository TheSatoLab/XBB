# XBB

## Summary:
In late 2022, the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron subvariants have highly diversified, and XBB variant is spreading rapidly around the world. Our phylogenetic analyses suggested that XBB emerged by recombination of two co-circulating BA.2 lineages, BJ.1 and BM.1.1.1 (a progeny of BA.2.75), during the summer of 2022 around India.
